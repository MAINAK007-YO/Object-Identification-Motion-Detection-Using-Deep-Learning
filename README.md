# Object-Identification-Motion-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This process includes capturing the real time data using camera module, detect the unwanted movement using computer vision and also identify the object is responsible to creating this movement and the whole details of this movement is transferred with the object name to the user mail. Tech Stack: OpenCV(Python), IoT
